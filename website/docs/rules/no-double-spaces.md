## Rule Details

Markdown treats double or more spaces as a single space. Double spaces in Markdown sentences are usually typos or mistakes and can be hard to spot. This rule will help keep your code clean and consistent.

This rule only checks for **double** spaces ***in the middle of sentences*** and applies only to [`text`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast?tab=readme-ov-file#text) node.

Since **leading** and **trailing** spaces have special meaning in markdown, this rule will not check for them. **Leading** spaces are used for creating code blocks or indentation, and **trailing** spaces are used to create line breaks.

### ❌ Incorrect

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```md
foo  bar
```

foo bar␣␣
