# Migration Guide

This chapter provides guidance for migrating to `eslint-markdown` from other popular Markdown linting tools like `@eslint/markdown`, `markdownlint`, `remark-lint`, and `textlint`.

## Migrating from `@eslint/markdown`

`eslint-markdown` is a complete super-set of `@eslint/markdown`, so migration is straightforward.

You can use `eslint-markdown` as a drop-in replacement for `@eslint/markdown` by updating your ESLint configuration to use `eslint-markdown`'s recommended configuration.

Every rule provided by `@eslint/markdown` is included in this package. (NOTE: I'm also a dedicated maintainer of `@eslint/markdown`)

Follow these steps to migrate your project:
