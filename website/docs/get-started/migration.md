# Migration Guide

This chapter provides guidance for migrating to `eslint-markdown` from other popular Markdown linting tools like [`@eslint/markdown`](https://github.com/eslint/markdown), [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), `remark-lint`, and `textlint`.

## Migrating from [`@eslint/markdown`](https://github.com/eslint/markdown)

`eslint-markdown` is a complete super-set of `@eslint/markdown`, so migration is straightforward.

You can use `eslint-markdown` as a drop-in replacement for `@eslint/markdown` by updating your ESLint configuration to use `eslint-markdown`'s recommended configuration.

Every rule provided by `@eslint/markdown` is included in this package. (NOTE: I'm also a dedicated maintainer of `@eslint/markdown`)

Follow these steps to migrate your project:

## Migrating from [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)

If you are a user of [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), [`markdownlint-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli), or [`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2)
